### Algorithmic Implementations

#### Self-Amplifying Recursive Learning

```python
def analyze_signal_strength(data):
    # Calculate average accuracy and response time
    avg_accuracy = calculate_accuracy(data)
    avg_response_time = calculate_response_time(data)
    
    # Meta-contextual signal strength calculation
    signal_strength = 0.95 * avg_accuracy - 0.05 * avg_response_time
    
    return {'avg_accuracy': avg_accuracy, 
            'avg_response_time': avg_response_time,
            'signal_strength': signal_strength}

def optimize_learning_model(model, data):
    # Predict signal strength based on meta-features
    predicted_strength = model.predict(data)
    
    # Calculate error for optimization
    error = calculate_mean_squared_error(data['signal_strength'], predicted_strength)
    
    # Dynamic learning rate adjustment
    learning_rate = 0.1
    
    # Update accuracy with weighted adjustment
    updated_accuracy = data['avg_accuracy'] + learning_rate * error
    
    return {'updated_accuracy': updated_accuracy, 
            'predicted_strength': predicted_strength}
```

#### Probabilistic Recursion Throttling

```python
def compute(x, gamma=0.8, beta=1.5):
    # Base case
    if x == 0:
        return 'base_case'
    
    # Generate options with probabilities
    options = [
        (x + 1, 0.6),   # 60% chance to add 1
        (x - 1, 0.3),   # 30% chance to subtract 1
        (x * 2, 0.1)    # 10% chance to double x
    ]
    
    # Calculate entropy
    total_probability = sum(p for _, p in options)
    entropy = -sum((p/total_probability) * log2(p/total_probability) for _, p in options)
    
    # Make decision based on entropy
    if entropy > 1:
        return compute(random_choice([x + 1, x - 1]), gamma, beta)
    else:
        return compute(options[0][0], gamma, beta)
```
