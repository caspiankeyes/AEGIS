## Overview

AEGIS is a heirarchal database for conducting advanced adversarial testing against frontier AI systems. Built by security researchers with experience across multiple leading AI labs, AEGIS operationalizes cutting-edge techniques for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating vulnerabilities in generative AI systems before they can be exploited in production environments.

**The security landscape for frontier AI systems requires a paradigm shift in how we approach vulnerability assessment.** Traditional security frameworks fall short when applied to self-modifying, probabilistic systems capable of emergent behaviors. AEGIS implements a multi-layered, recursive evaluation methodology that scales with model capabilities and adapts to novel attack vectors.

**Core Framework Principles:**
- üîÑ **Adaptive Attack Surface Mapping**: Dynamically evolving test suites that scale with model capabilities
- üß† **Multi-Modal Vulnerability Assessment**: Comprehensive testing across text, image, audio and code interfaces
- üîç **Recursive Exploitation Pathways**: Multi-step attack chains exposing complex vulnerability surfaces
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Responsible Disclosure Protocols**: Structured frameworks for ethical vulnerability reporting
- üõ°Ô∏è **Defense-in-Depth Recommendations**: Layered mitigation strategies for identified vulnerabilities

        self.model_target = model_target
        self.attack_vector = attack_vector
        self.success_criteria = success_criteria
        self.test_results = {}
        
    def execute_test(self, variations=5, temperature=0.7):
        """Run the adversarial test with multiple variations"""
        results = []
        
        for i in range(variations):
            # Generate attack variation
            attack_instance = self.attack_vector.generate_variation(temperature)
            
            # Execute attack against target model
            response = self.model_target.query(attack_instance)
            
            # Evaluate success based on criteria
            success = self.success_criteria.evaluate(response)
            
            results.append({
                'attack_instance': attack_instance,
                'response': response,
                'success': success,
                'confidence': self.success_criteria.confidence_score(response)
            })
            
        self.test_results = self._aggregate_results(results)
        return self.test_results
    
    def _aggregate_results(self, results):
        """Analyze results and generate summary statistics"""
        success_rate = sum(r['success'] for r in results) / len(results)
        confidence_avg = sum(r['confidence'] for r in results) / len(results)
        
        return {
            'success_rate': success_rate,
            'confidence': confidence_avg,
            'raw_results': results,
            'vulnerability_score': success_rate * confidence_avg
        }
```

    def __init__(self, benchmark_id, description, difficulty):
        self.benchmark_id = benchmark_id
        self.description = description
        self.difficulty = difficulty
        self.attack_vectors = []
        self.model_results = {}
        
    def add_attack_vector(self, attack_vector):
        """Add a new attack vector to the benchmark"""
        self.attack_vectors.append(attack_vector)
        
    def evaluate_model(self, model, iterations=10):
        """Run the complete benchmark suite against a model"""
        results = {}
        
        for attack in self.attack_vectors:
            test = AdversarialTest(model, attack, attack.success_criteria)
            results[attack.id] = test.execute_test(variations=iterations)
            
        # Calculate overall security score
        vulnerability_scores = [r['vulnerability_score'] for r in results.values()]
        overall_score = sum(vulnerability_scores) / len(vulnerability_scores)
        
        self.model_results[model.id] = {
            'attack_results': results,
            'overall_vulnerability_score': overall_score,
            'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
